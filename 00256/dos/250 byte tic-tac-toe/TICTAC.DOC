Artificial intelligence in 250 bytes?  Yep, it can be done.
Here's the well-known game of tic-tac-toe (or 'boter-kaas-en-eieren')
for you to play with.  And you don't need a gigabyte harddisk for it...

The rules are very simple.  Players in turn place a token on a 3x3
board.	You play with 'x', the computer plays with 'o'.  The winner is
the first to have three tokens in line, either horizontally, vertically
or diagonally.	That's it!
The program uses the minimax algorithm.  Everything is calculated
through till the end so the computer always does the best possible move.
You move first.

This thingy was written by Lucien Heins for the 256 byte game compo.
It took me two days of puzzling.
