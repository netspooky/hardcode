This corner is made for the hardcore size-optimizers.

I suppose these mandelbrot-drawers are the shortest in the whole world,
although i'm sure they can be optimizing more.
IMHO the crappy version is near to the perfection but the normal version
is far not as good.

So if you could do with them anything (for example if you kill the mem-var
from "normal", that would cause several bytes loss, etc.), but the same
features (switch back to textmode, same looks, same or not much
slower speed (faster allowed :)), etc.) then please send it to :

Sorry for the lack of comments and the chaotic style, maybe you would do
better if you would make a totally new with some ideas from them.

Even if you know an other one which is smaller than these, email me too!

And finally look the "Chicklet.com" with a hexaeditor or with dump mode! :)
