...You've seen this before? Then you are right. I grabbed it many years ago
from somewhere when it was still in its former full-size-glory of 3500 odd
bytes.

It was originally called "CIRC_2.COM", and all I have done it taken out all
of the usuless wasted bytes that were in it, and have called it PAL.COM.
All credits go to the original writer, whomever he or she was.

This is only a Bonus demo, and is not in the compo.

Bushy.
