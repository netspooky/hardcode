  Well ppl, here it is. This is not much of a sourcecode but an old unfinished
proggy sleeping in my HD; then i decided to distribute it as a sourcecode, so
begginers could make themselves idea of mode 13h programming. Do whatever
you want with it except (of course) changing GFX and/or ripping. Now i see this
stuff i could imagine a billon ways to speed it up, please don't take it that
seriously.

  I guess i should write some tech notes here... aw, well... let me see...
haven't seen this almost half an year... Well, as you may see all the action
is mode 13h, so a lot of optimizing was made for fiiting all that movement in
the rastertime of my (ex)386DX. First of all, you could use .386 and take ad-
ventage of 386 specific opcodes. The ball plotter uses bits for storing info
(???), and that part is the real bottle-neck of the whole stuff. I could get
'em onto separate variables for some boost, but i wanted less size, so speed
came after, sorry (yes, 4 bytes, but whatahell :))).

  There IS a major problem with the ball plotting routine itself: it doesn't
skip background color correctly, so balls will cut themselves when aproaching.
I discovered that little typo after spreading it... well, try to correct it
if you want ;)))

  For more info and contacting, there you have MISC.NFO. l8r.
