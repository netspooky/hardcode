This bbstro was made for the good people at Organized Kaos BBS of joy,
namely Kurrupt, who asked us to do a BBStro, and we did :P
Featuring the first 100% hand-drawn art by Goblin ;), a wild transparent
font "scroller" drawn and coded by random, and some tune from somewhere, by
someone, and thanks to the Reality crew for making the wonderful RAD.
Oh, and there's an ANSi by Kurrupt in there as well, and all under 10k ;)
It took ages cos we were lazy, but it was fun. :)
Info text's suck.
So nyer.
