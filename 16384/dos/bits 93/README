    suite of programs written for Fresh week 1993 for Bits - The University
    of Bristol Computer Society (of which I am President).

    It was written in 2 days from scratch and so is not as optimised as it
    perhaps should be. It demonstrates a multi-coloured sine-wave scroll text
    scrolling over a static background with a 'lens' effect bouncing over
    the top of them both.

    It was written on a 33MHz 486 with a Paradise 90c30 graphics chipset on
    an 11MHz bus. If you run it on anything less, then don't blame me if it
    either doesn't work, or goes horribly slowly! If you machine isn't
    fast enough, then it will probably all flicker horribly as I haven't
    used double buffering (tut tut).

    I have included the full source code for this demo. Please feel free to
    examine it. I apologise in advance for the lack of comments, and the
    code may be hard to follow simply because it has been optimised. If you
    find the code useful, a greet would be appreciated in any demo you write.
    Please don't just blatently rip it off.

    The program is designed to be compiled using Turbo Assabler (TASM).
    You may or may not have problems trying to recompile it under anything
    else. If you want to alter the text or change the lense effect, then
    you will also need GWBASIC to redo the tables.

    I am currently seeking to join a demo group of some description
    (preferably one with a good musician/graphics artist) - email me if you
    are interested.
