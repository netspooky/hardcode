탤컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴 intro info 컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
-- 
-- I fucking hate to code under stress. But for little more than
-- one week ago I decided to do an intro, FROM SCRATCH, no previous
-- routines, no music player, no music, no nothing, so this is a 
-- a stress production. Sorry for the lack of quality design, but
-- my mom wasnt available, snq's mom wasnt either.
--                  
-- WHY IS IT SOO SLOW? Maybe you dont have a geForce?
-- I am using projective texturing pretty much, so a
-- e.g a TNT2 goes at 6fps =). This intro was made for
-- the ASM2k compo computer.
--                  
-- Yes, there are some bugs, graphic glitches etc.                 
-- I tried to fix them before the deadline, but ... :/            
--                  
--                  
-- special greets go out to the following people for being so
-- kind to send me tunes very fast and allowing me to use 'em.
