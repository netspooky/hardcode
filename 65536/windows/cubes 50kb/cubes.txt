1. How to play
==============
Try not to collide with the red cubes and collect the power-ups (blue thingies). By tapping left/right you can change your current position. Use space to jump. It's that easy :P 

There are the following power-ups avaiable:
 1. Speed up
 2. Speed Down
 3. Jump Enabled
 4. Drunken Mode
 5. Invincible
 6. "Flashbang"
 7. No Cubes
 8. get a life 
 9. Megajump
 10.Powerup-Mania
 11.Random chaos


2. Requirements
===============
fast pc, fast gfx-card, sound :p


3. Parameters
=============
Here are some nice parameters you can use for your enjoyment:

 "-gentex" : generates textures & saves them to disk. next time you start the game, those saved textures are used -> faster startup :D

 "-qt"     : play windowed and in 400x300. whoa, what a feature!!1

use only one parameter at a time.


4. Cheats
=========
  Yes. there are some. they suck :P


5. Greets
=========
