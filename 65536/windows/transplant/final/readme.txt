.Introduction
Dear friends, fans and enemies. 
BC labs is hereby handing out free visitor
passes to the Enigma3 research facility. Please
note that the Dev area is currently closed due to 
DX11 construction work.

.Now Hiring
Since our current lab configuration is "Three coders 
and a mic", the BC staff kindly invites you to 
try out our fine tool, e.g. for individual taste 
refinements. We're looking forward to hearing from 
and/or working with you.

.Background
The Enigma3 facility opened in 2009, after facing
serious capacity limits at the good old Enigma2 site.
Classic werkkzeug technology was used to build its 
primary foundations - even color schemes and operator
workflows were abusively reused in the construction
process. However, the lab complex you're about to visit 
will nevertheless provide you with some fresh insight into 
amendment cultivations, some of which are still subject
to ongoing research.

.Synth
Part of the labs audio synthesis division products
are available to consumers at www.tunefish-synth.com ,
where you may try out our new tasty Tunefish3 meal, served 
in a convinient "to go" VSTI box.

.Tool and Source Release
Following recent violations of the labs quarantine
guidelines, bug sightings have beem reported to the 
Lab management. We therefore allow entrance only
to experienced visitors that are fine with an on-your-
own-risk exhibition policy. In general, Enigma3 source
entrance passes are non-refundable - you cannot return 
or exchange them, nor expect any future updates or fixes.
Further, all exhibited code remains property of its 
respective author - which is not necessarily the BC staff 
(hi chaos, ryg, ..., unknown guy from the internet !).

.Sightseeing Visitors
If you are in a hurry or only interested in visiting
the site's primary exposés, we invite you to try our Express
Route Shuttle at /binary/estudio3_s.exe. There, you can have 
a look at operators in their natural habitate and even export
them to a nice script on your very own: just choose one cute
Demo Op and hit F5. However, to grow the little fellow into
a full sized demo you will need to take steps you will learn
only in the extended Source Code Route.

.Special Interest Visitors
Guests willing to take the full experience are invited to join
our Source Code Route. In order to have a pleasant visit,
we strongly advise you to bring the following equipment: 
a Windows OS (preferably 7), the latest DX SDK (e.g. June 2010), 
QT 4.8 (set the QTDIR env variable to the QT root), Visual 
Studio 2010 (set the working directory to ..\..\binary\ in the 
project properties) and some Java runtime environment available 
from the console. Once you are good to go, you can pick your favourite
demo script, put it into production.hpp and hit F7 to watch your 
very own demo slowly come to life. In case you prefer a really tiny 
litte runt, we suggest you try our pack_eplayer3.bat squeezing package.

.Outro
Thank you for carefully reading these security/information advices.
We wish you a pleasant stay.
