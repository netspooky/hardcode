    programs written for Fresh week 1993 for Bits - The University of Bristol
    Computer Society (of which I am President).

    It was written on a 33MHz 486 with a Paradise 90c30 graphics chipset on
    an 11MHz bus. If you run it on anything less, then don't blame me if it
    either doesn't work, or goes horribly slowly! Seriously though, if you
    do have any major problems, then email me and I'll see what I can do.

    I have included the full source code for this demo. Please feel free to
    examine it. I apologise in advance for the lack of comments, and the
    code may be hard to follow simply because it has been optimised. If you
    find the code useful, a greet would be appreciated in any demo you write.
    Please don't just blatently rip it off.

    The source should compile fine using Borland C++ (I used V2.0) though you
    will have to change the include/library directories to get it to compile.

    I am currently seeking to join a demo group of some description
    (preferably one with a good musician/graphics artist) - email me if you
    are interested.
