    telling the truth, we planned to released this intro at TheParty, but
    after finnishing it, we thought that it's a little bit unfinnished:)
    and dont looks like we wanted at the time, when all work began. 
    so we decided to released it at Astrosyn'97.

    we recommend to watch it at least on p120 machine with 16megs of ram
    and gravis. this intro work in two modes. of course hicolor mode 
    (320x200x15bpp) is the best and if you can - run it. fake mode is 
    emulated at 640x400x8bpp and looks a bit lame. but it's work.
    this intro was tested at s3 trio64 v+ (hicolor) and trident 9000b (fake).
    if you meet any problems, try to load "univbe", probably it will help.
    and one more request. please enable "blur" option, because this intro
    looks better with it, although it slow down a little.

   tak wiec w paru miejscach nie zdarzylismy. ja (czyli bartol) mam
   dostep do mojego komputera raz na dwa tygodnie przez jeden dzien
   (wynika to z tego ze studiuje dosyc daleko od domu),
   tak wiec nie sposob jest poprawic wszystkie bledy w intrze.
   takze w paru miejscach efekty powinny inaczej wygladac, ale nie
   bylo niestety czasu aby to ulepszyc.
