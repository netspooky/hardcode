   eh. so it's my first realtime raytracing. it's very slow, beacuse
   99% of code is written in pure C. eh. you know. it's more easy to
   code this in C using floats than in pure asm...
   but nevermind. i dont optymalized it, because i have written it in
   just two days. only watcom probably optymized it...
   so as i said before, it's realtime raytrace. i put here only 
   phong illumination, shadows and texture mapping. nothing else.
   scenes were created using only balls, planes and cylinders.
   there's four modes for this intro. you choose mode by typing parametr
   when you run intro (defaul is mode 3), so:

     boomaie mode1 - 108800 rpf (rays per frame)
     boomaie mode2 - 27200 rpf
     boomaie mode3 - 12080 rpf 
     boomaie mode4 - 6800 rpf

   rememeber that this is number of rays that i traced to get points of
   intersection and checking shadows.
 
   when you choose mode other that first mode, pixel will be copied, and
   not interpolated. so, in second mode, pixels will have size 2x2,
   in third mode 3x3 and last mode 4x4.
   it was made for speed. you know...i have only 486 processor 
   and when i coded this i dont tested it at any other computer.
   ok. that's all. and remember that it's not optymized code!
