                          -------------------------
                           The Official Invitation
                          -------------------------




1.> WHAT

   This  file  wants  to  tell  you  that  there  will be a quite delicious
   computer  demo festival this year, involving all the platforms which are
   important  in  the  guild  of  the  demomakers,  namely Amiga, PC, C-64,
   Archimedes and the Atari ST/Falcon.  Think twice before missing it!

                     **\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/**

2.> WHO

   This  event  is  held  by  three of the most experienced party-organizer
   teams  in  Germany:   the people behind the 680XX-Convention (1993), the
   Black  Box  Symposium (1995) and the Fried Bits.  For the Symposium '96,
   which  we plan to become the best German party so far, these three teams
   fusioned  for  not  standing  in  competition  to each other but joining
   forces and making everything better than ever!

   The  groups  involved  are:   Polka  Brothers,  Lego Club, Phantasm (for
   Amiga), Avena, Absence (for Atari) and Oxyron (for C-64).

                     **\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/**

3.> WHY

   We, the organizers, observed that the amount of poorly organized and too
   commercial  parties  increased  during  the  last years, even outside of
   Germany.   Our  country  has  always  been  well  known for low-standard
   parties, but 1995 has been the most disappointing year.

   We (and probably the rest of the scene, too) felt that it was time for a
   party  where  you  could  have  fun  again,  a  party that would be well
   organized,  and  NOT  a  party  at  which  you feel that not you is what
   counts, but the money.

   We don't want to rent huge congress centres, we don't want to organize a
   party  with hundreds of super-duper hyper interactive virtual multimedia
   features,  we  don't want to make money - we all just want a party where
   you  are  welcome to have a nice time; which is, after all, what a party
   is ought to be.

                     **\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/**

4.> WHEN

   Eastern 1996.  Four days of fun and experience:

   START  5th April, 1200 CET
   END    8th April, 1200 CET

   The  entrace  fee  will  amount  to  35DM.   We  will not accept foreign
   currencies.

                     **\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/**

5.> WHERE

   A  nice  convention center called "Veranstaltungszentrum Burg Seevetal",
   which  is located in the very near south of Hamburg, Germany.  It offers
   place for about 1000 people including computers, a really big screen and
   surround  sound.   You  don't  have  to  be afraid of 24h of loud music,
   though...

   You  can reach it via everything.  If you're going to come by train, you
   first  have to reach Hamburg Hauptbahnhof (main station) and take the S3
   or  S31 (on Gleis 4, HVV price 4DM) to "Harburg", where we will pick you
   up  with  the  Symposium shuttle service.  Alternatively, you can use of
   the hourly public busses to "Seevetal".

   Coming  by  plane,  you  will use the bus shuttle service to the station
   "Ohlsdorf", wait for the U1, get out at Hamburg Hauptbahnhof and, again,
   take the S3/S31 to reach "Harburg".

   If   you   arrive   by  ship,  then  you'll  have  to  take  the  U3  at
   "Landungsbrcken" to reach the Hauptbahnhof.

   If  you  come by spaceship, there is a big area on the other side of the
   Symposium  convention center; please try to land it there (parking is of
   course free).

   For  the  case that you own a car, you have two possibilities to arrive:
   The  A1  ("Autobahn  1") and the A7.  Coming from the north or south via
   A7/B4,  you  have  to  leave at Abfahrt "Fleestedt".  Then roll down the
   "Hittfelder  Landstraáe" (part of the B4) southwards and follow the sign
   "Veranstaltungszentrum".   Coming  from  east  or  west via A1, take the
   Abfahrt "Hittfeld" and follow the signs.

                     **\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/**

6.> COMPETITIONS

   Yes,  a  lot!  Not only demo and intro competitions for all the computer
   systems  and  the  usual  module,  multichannel  and graphics compos are
   included.   There  will  also be compos for video demos, a wild compo, a
   coding   compo   (4K-intro)   etc.    We   will   even   hold  an  Acorn
   Archimedes/RISC-PC competition, if there will be enough entries present.
   Or  a  Silicon  Graphics democompo, if more than one entry exists...  No
   limits!
