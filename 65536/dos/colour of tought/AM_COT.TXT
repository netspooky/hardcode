บ After the release of  Frosty, RubiXcom decided he should release something ณ
บ as well.  Here is our second rushed  Happy New Year production - Colour of ณ
บ Thought.                                                                   ณ
บ                                                                            ณ
บ This intro features a slightly extended 3D system than the one featured in ณ
บ Transmission.  This is our first demo  in HiColour  and I ho pe everything ณ
บ works well. :)  For  that to  occur you need  at least a Vesa 1.2  with  a ณ
บ 320x200 16 bit colour mode!  Get Univbe  as a  last resort, i f you see no ณ
บ graphics. I realise that some crap cards refuse to support lowres hicolour ณ
บ modes but there wasn't much time to include support for other modes. Sorry.ณ
บ                                                                            ณ
บ Please use  at least a  486 to run  the demo.  I haven't tried  it under a ณ
บ lesser  system  but I guess it will crash horribly as there is no floating ณ
บ math  emulator in the code! Use  a Pentium  like a  166MMX which is what I ณ
บ used to code this thing.  On this  computer (at least)  everything runs OK ณ
บ so if in doubt go buy faster hardware. :)                                  ณ
บ                                                                            ณ
บ To enjoy NOR's techno  soundtrack you need to have  at least a GUS classic ณ
บ and an ULTRASND string setup correctly. The demo uses MXMPlayer from Cubic ณ
บ Team and it seems to work on my old GUS just fine.                         ณ
บ                                                                            ณ
บ In the complete testing phase  (about 5 minutes)  I haven't seen this code ณ
บ crush. I also tried  the demo under Win95 and  it works fine so I guess it ณ
บ should work fine with WinNT and Win98.                                     ณ
บ                                                                            ณ

บ This was meant to be released a year after the release of the original DOS ณ
บ version but due to problems with the operation of the sound system DLL and ณ
บ my unique brand of lazines,  this hasn't happened.  Now, finally two month ณ
บ too late, here it is, the Windows 95 version of COT.  As this version uses ณ
บ window's  graphics  drivers,  most anyone with Win95 can view the demo and ณ
บ hear the sound.                                                            ณ

บ If  there are  any problems try to  fiddle around with  the options on the ณ
บ setup window.  The fullscreen  mode is not avalible on most cards so if in ณ
บ doubt  switch that off.  As for the  sound system,  it hasn't given me any ณ
บ trouble when tested under typical hardware setup. If it stuffs up it could ณ
บ only mean you got bad sound driver support for your card,  the only way to ณ
บ fix this is either to get a new card or download new drivers.              ณ
บ                                                                            ณ
บ In my opinion, the DOS version is  faster and sounds  better but since the ณ
บ Windows  version uses  24bbp colour  (unless you are using a 16bbp desktop ณ
บ setting), it looks better. :-)                                             ณ
