บ     Since we are new and unknown, we had to get fame
บ     So, here is DREAM, our contribution to ASS'95 introcompo
บ
บ     Please don't take it too seriously : everything have been done in
บ     a hurry. The vector world has been finished the day we finished the
บ     intro itself !! And all the Gouraud related stuff are only some
บ     very young trials put there to have some consistant parts...
บ
บ     Moreover, we have absolutely no EXE packer ready, and we had no time
บ     to pack our different parts together in a single EXE
บ
บ     So, please forgive us, and we promise that our next productions will
บ     be better
บ

บ
บ     The rules of ASS'95 obliged us to use two different mod players in
บ     the intro... so, we had problem with the different ways to handle
บ     the timer, and we decided that the intro wouldn't be synchronised !!
บ     Yes, it's lame
บ     So, if you want to enjoy the thing at the original speed, try it on
บ     a 486 DX2/66... and neither less nor more powerfull computer.
บ
บ     You will need :
บ        a 386... and a 486 DX2/66 for experiencing the real thing
บ        HIMEM, EMM, QEMM... whatever you want since we use only less
บ         than 500 Ko of low memory
บ        plus the other habitual stuff (keyboard, screen, brain...)
บ
บ     How to run the...
บ        Competition version
บ         just type DREAM [x] where x is the optional 2x0h specification
บ         of your GUS baseport
บ        CD version
บ         if DREAM alone doesn't work, try to set the Midas parameters :
บ         -sx     Force Sound Device x (1 = GUS, 2 = PAS, 3 = WSS, 4 = SB,
บ                 5 = No Sound)
บ         -pxxx   Force I/O port xxx (hex) for Sound Device
บ         -ix     Force IRQ x for Sound Device
บ         -dx     Force DMA channel x for Sound Device
บ         -mxxxx  Set mixing rate to xxxx Hz
บ         -oxxx   Force output mode (8 = 8-bit, 1 = 16-bit, s = stereo,
บ                 m = mono)

บ
บ     Two versions of the intro exist :
บ
บ       The competition version is the TRUE thing in our point of view :
บ        its size is under 64Ko, it supports only GUS, and is 100%ASM
บ       The "CD version" has been made only to comply with the strange
บ        rules of ASS'95. It has a lot of disadvantages : its size is far
บ        greater than 64Ko, it supports GUS and SB, it uses the Pascal
บ        version of Midas (because very very very little time to do it)
บ
บ     So, since it most unlikely that we will do a "final" version, for we
บ     prefer to spend our time on further projects, be sure to get the
บ     competition version.

บ
บ     Aaaargh !!
บ     We planned to release this intro with a cool chiptune from bopy...
บ     But we (Kortal & Fanor) had a MEGABIGPROBLEM during the linking :
บ     the module had a bug and didn't work well with Gusplay or Midas...
บ     So we had to take another one...
บ     But you will hear this tune in a further production !!
บ     Sorry bopy !

บ     Fanor thanks his little brother a.k.a. Benot Dumas a.k.a.
บ     Da-Thing-Out-Of-The-Space, for lending him his computer while
บ     Kortal was at home
บ
บ     Fanor also thanks Garfield... without him, Da-Thing-Etc would not
บ     have lend him his computer. Well... it's quite complicated, but you
บ     are not supposed to understand. Thanks Garfield !!!
บ
บ     Kortal wants to be sorry, but at the origin there have to be a
บ     VectorWorld on the intro instead of the Landscape but as there were
บ     a lot of bugs... and lack of time... I decide to put my landscape
บ     wich was coded a long time ago, and wich I appreciate a lot !
