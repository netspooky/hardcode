	Notes

The intro is licensed for anyone to use for any purpose. Specifically, under
BSD licence. Details here: http://eu.conecta.it/paper/BSD_licence.html

Compo version is programmed to work in FreeBSD. The intro is portable, but the
other versions might not be anywhere near 4 kilobytes. Supported platforms
provided in the distribution package include:
	freebsd-i386 (compo platform)
	linux-ia32
	linux-amd64
	linux-ppc32
	osx-ppc32
	osx-ppc64
	windows-ia32
If you can provide us with another kind of binary, please do. It will get
included in the package.

If you want to compile the intro yourself, please use SCons build system,
the compilation scripts compile.pl and compile.sh are made for searching gcc
flags to make the intro smaller and quickly build and pack it (respectively).
They only work in any reliable manner on FreeBSD 6.2-RELEASE i386.

4k intros made by FIT/Bandwagon, specifically some additional reference
material by Marq have been used for ideas on how to make the intro smaller.
However, the actual implementation borrows no code. Big thanks anyway!

	Troubleshooting

In BSD and Linux, the intro does not link or check it's dependencies
compile-time, rather it dynamically loads all symbols on the fly. Thus, if the
intro segfaults on startup, check that at least following libraries are
installed:

	libGL
	libGLU
	libglut
	libSDL

In release builds the dynamic loader prints symbol addresses, so if they
are missing for a particular library, it isn't found on your system and
you should make sure it's installed.
