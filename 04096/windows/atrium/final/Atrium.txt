present

a 4k intro for Breakpoint 2008

"Atrium"

Credits:

Mentor: Object generator, synth, rendering
Puryx: Music
Blueberry: Object modelling tool
Lemmus: Modelling, design, direction

Thanks to Maytz/Loonies for help with colours and design.

Requirements: PS/VS 2.0, DirectX end-user runtime February 2005 (d3dx9_24.dll).

The most notable fix in this hopefully final version is that rendering
now uses 16-bit index buffers exclusively, but in more passes. This
seems to be necessary as some nvidia drivers apparently are still having
trouble handling 32-bit buffers *sigh*.

We provide the intro in 1080i and 720p versions under 4k. We also provide
a larger version with a proper setup dialog, including a resolution selector
and other nifty options. 

Thanks to Gargaj for publicizing the fwzSetup code on which we have loosely
based our dialog code :). Thanks!
