  : what you need to know
 
    this is the source-release of "stoerfall ost", our winning
    4kb intro that was first shown at Dialogos 2000.
    within this release we give you almost the full sourcecode,
    with some comments for better understanding.
    for a complete recompile you will need masm 5 (or higher).
    to make it more interesting we left out our 'special
    compression tool' :)  so don't feel surprised if the executable 
    cannot be compressed to it's original size (4kb).
    furthermore we decided to release the source under the gpl
    to protect our rights. for the precise terms of copying,
    distribution and modification have a look at the included
    gpl.txt file.
