บ Well it's that time of the year again, the end of it to be exact. :-) Mad  ณ
บ shopping sprees, the burning of Xmas merchandise, drink driving await as   ณ
บ well as the traditional end of the year release from AM!                   ณ
บ                                                                            ณ
บ This 4k was started by NOR at the Coven 98 blitz competition. It was monthsณ
บ later that I was able to do more work on it. After watching a few 4k       ณ
บ productions which featured music I decided to give Reality's AdLib tracker,ณ
บ Rad, a go and to my surprise the music and the player still left me quite  ณ
บ a lot of space to squeeze in a few effects. This is the result of about a  ณ
บ month of on and off coding. The music is not much to listen to but it is   ณ
บ the best I could do under the size restrictions. The 4k contains a         ณ
บ significantly cut-down version of Reality's Rad player coded by            ณ
บ Shayde/Reality while the rest of the code is by me.                        ณ
บ                                                                            ณ
บ The program should run under MS-DOS utilising anything with a co-prossesor ณ
บ and a VGA gfx adapter but I do recommend a fast setup to really enjoy some ณ
บ effects. Windows 95/NT/98 is not recommended. A sound card is also a good  ณ
บ thing to have installed. Any old AdLib compatible should work. An AdLib    ณ
บ emulator for Gravis, however, is not worth the bother.                     ณ
บ                                                                            ณ
บ I would like to thank, RubiXcom for his suggestions and some help on       ณ
บ optimising the program.                                                    ณ
