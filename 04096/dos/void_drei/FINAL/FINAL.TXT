        hello world!

                this is shiva typing, just feeling the need to say some
                things about this final version.
                first, the final is quite a bit larger, as i added or
                changed the following two things:
                + speed up some routines that were really too extremly
                  slow (like unrolling color components).
                + added two (still quite slow) blitter routines, so
                  void3 is a bit more "graphics card" friendly.
                  the 8bit mode looks bad, of course and you do not get
                  a good impression of the colorful textures.
                ok, so enjoy...
                the real source will be released at ms00.

                cya, shiva of kolor
