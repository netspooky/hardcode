                        Wired'97 4K-intro compo entry
                              Reached place #?




Fuckin' DISCLAIMER message:
-=========================-

  If your PC burns, if your dog dies, if Martians attack your town, if your
little sister throws your mouse through the window (even if the window was
closed), or anything else that you would want to reproach to me, that is NOT
my fault, nor the fault of this 4K intro.
  But if you win at the lotery, or anything that could make you happy, that's
probably thanks to me! :)




Required equipment:
-=================-

  . 386sx processor (or better)
  . about 200K of free conventional memory (or more)
  . VGA (MCGA) card (or better)
  . sense of humour (or better :))




How to use this intro?
-====================-

  Type "poorguy!" and then put any of your fingers on the <Enter> key and lift
your finger down until you think the things your are seeing are no more the 
DOS prompt but the intro.
  Of course if your are not running this intro from DOS (in other terms, if
you are another of these poor souls converted to Win95), you'll just have to 
"double-click on the icon" TM (R) Copyright (C) Lamesoft, all rights reserved.

  During the intro, if you think it suxx too much (in other words, if you are
a lamer), or if your mom arrives and can be shocked by the XXX hardcore porn
scene :) at the end of this intro, you can furiously hit the <Escape> key.
  I *HATE* demos (even more if they suck) that don't allow to escape during 
their execution!




Why did I make this intro?
-========================-

  Because I wanted to! (Well actually... I'd really like to have sex with a
top model, but I haven't yet... So, I think it's easier to make intros :))




How did I get the idea?
-=====================-

  I think I had the idea by myself... But I find more and more that my sub-
conscious must have taken it from Statix/PsychicLink's Paper 64K intro... Doh!
  I've seen recently that another "paper" 4K intro had been made (Paper2 by
Byteam), but I swear I didn't know that when I started mine. Anyway, I've 
never seen it because it refused to run on the 3 different PCs I tried. So I
guess (hope) it suxx :).




Regrets:
-======-

  I'd have liked to include more scenes and more frames but you know it's only
a 4K intro... And it was hard enough to put all these pictures in a so small
file (Code=about 620 bytes; Data=all the rest).
  I also would have liked to add more graphic effects (interference, palette
fadings, etc.).
  But my main regret is that it takes a bit more than 1 VBL to display the 
screen on a 486 so it is twice too slow on these machines, otherwise it would 
have been twice too fast on any Pentium (you know, it's hard to test the speed 
of a computer in only 4K...).




How to contact me?
-================-

  Whether it would be for congratulations or critics, you can write to me at:

  e-mail (prefered) : maritaud@alphainfo.unilim.fr

  snail-mail (post) : Karl Maritaud

And now... The usual part of an nfo file that is useless for people who are
not in it, but extremely important for the few others :) ... The greetings:

I'd like to thank Frenzy for his POST.EXE file... It surely was easy to make,
but it saved my time so I didn't have to write mine. ;)
