We guess you all know what to do ;)

FAQ
===

Q: Why not a cool gameover sound or at least more levels?
A: We decided to invest all bytes into one big turrican style level.
   Expect more (and larger) levels soon (maybe at the party).

Q: The game doesn't run smooth on my machine
A: You should have at least 300 Mhz and a nice MMX capable processor
   The game runs much faster in the optimized version, but size improvements
   forced us to remove certain hash-tables and sorting algorithms to gain
   some bytes




Special thanx to factor 5 for the turrican amiga game
